# Heart Disease Analysis Using EDA

## Overview
This project performs an extensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization on a heart disease dataset using Python.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of several medical parameters that help in predicting heart disease. Below are the key features:

- **age**: Age in years
- **sex**: (1 = male; 0 = female)
- **cp**: Chest pain type
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **fbs**: (Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- **target**: Presence of heart disease (1 = yes; 0 = no)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Data cleaning and formatting
   - Feature selection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summary of the dataset
   - Visualization of key trends and patterns
   - Correlation analysis between variables

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms and distribution plots
   - Box plots for outlier detection
   - Heatmaps for correlation analysis

4. **Machine Learning (If Applicable)**
   - Model selection
   - Training and testing the model
   - Evaluating performance metrics
